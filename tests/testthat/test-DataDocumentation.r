# Check a single table documentation XML file.
# This checks three things:
# 1. It is actually properly formed XML that can be read by an XML parser
# 2. It conforms to the XML Schema for this sort of file. (Found in the same folder as the XML files themselves.)
# 3. It additionally has properly formed columns. (This can't be checked with an XML Schema, I think, since XML is context-free.) That is:
#     a)  A column of levelsType "Municipalities" contains no additional information on levels, one of levelsType NumericRange contains
#         at most information on upper and lower limits of the range, and one of levelsType Character contains information on at least
#         one level.
#     b)  No two columns share a name or share an alias. (And no single column has the same alias listed twice, or an alias equal to the identifier)
#     c)  No two levels of one column share a name or share an alias. (And no single level has an alias equal to the levelName or a duplicate alias)
# Note that this not at all check that the documentation is *correct* -- the file it claims to be documenting might not even exist,
# and these tests would still not fail. It only checks that the file *could* be the documentation of a table.
# All this is divided into one actual test each, so that eventual errors can be granularly identified.
checkFormatConformity <- function(filename) {
  # For prettier output from our tests, let's just write the name of the file, not its whole path:

            expect_true(file.exists(filename))
            })
  if(!file.exists(filename)) {
    return(FALSE)
  }

  # Then, let's check that it is valid XML:
  test_that(paste("file ",fileShortName," is properly formed XML"),{
            parsedXML <- xml2::read_xml(filename, encoding="UTF-8")
            expect_true(exists("parsedXML"))

  xmlSchema <- xml2::read_xml(system.file("extdata", "TableDocumentationFormat.xsd", package = "SCBHandlerPlotter"), encoding="UTF-8")

  test_that(paste("file ",fileShortName," conforms to the XML Schema"), {
    expect_true(xml2::xml_validate(parsedXML, xmlSchema))

  # If the XML fails to conform to our schema, it makes no sense to continue testing, so we return FALSE to indicate
  # the tests failed: (We need to do this since the caller of the function needs to know whether to continue testing.)
  if (!xml2::xml_validate(parsedXML, xmlSchema)) {
    return(FALSE)
  }

  # Now the easy part of our testing is done -- the file does exist, and it is a proper XML file which conforms to
  # our XML Schema. It remains to test the things that cannot be checked just using a context-free grammar: That the
  # column specifications actually make sense for a table.
  # Specifically, what we need to check is that:
  #     a)  All columns levels specification are correct for their levelsType:
  #           i) a column of levelsType "Municipalities" contains no additional information on levels
  #           ii) a column of levelsType NumericRange contains at most information on upper and lower limits of the range,
  #               and does not have a maxLevel less than its minLevel
  #           iii) a column of levelsType Character contains information on at least one level
  #     b)  No two columns share an identifier or share an alias
  #     c)  Within each column, its identifier and aliases are all distinct
  #     d)  No two levels of one column share a name or share an alias
  #     e)  Within each level of each column, its name and aliases are all distinct
  # Points c) and e) strictly speaking probably wouldn't cause any errors if violated, but they're indicative that something
  # has gone wrong, so we still enforce them just to prevent bugs from arising later.

  # The first thing we do is turn the parsed XML into a nested list, since that is easier to work with. Note that, thanks to
  # the XML Schema validation, we know quite a bit about its structure already, so for example we can immediately jump into
  # the <table></table> tags and then into the <columns></columns> tags, which is where we need to be working:
  columnsList <- xml2::as_list(parsedXML)$table$columns

  # The way to structure this is that we loop over all columns, and for each column we check a) and c)-e), and aggregate a
  # list of names and aliases of all the columns. Then, once the loop is done, we check that this list does not contain any
  # duplicate elements.
  columnIdentifiersAndAliases <- character(0)
  for (columnIndex in 1:(length(columnsList)-1)) { # -1 because the final element is the <valueColumn>, which was checked via XSD already.
    currentColumn <- columnsList[[columnIndex]]
    # The very first thing we can check is c), that this column has distinct identifier and aliases:
    currentColumnIdAndAliases <- character(0)
    # Append the identifier to our list of identifiers and aliases:
    currentColumnIdAndAliases <- append(currentColumnIdAndAliases, currentColumn$identifier[[1]][1])
    # We know that if there are no aliases, then we only have identifier, colname, and then levels. So conversely, if the total number
    # of tags is greater than three, we know the third until the n-1th tag must be an alias:
    if(length(currentColumn) > 3) {
      for (tagIndex in 3:(length(currentColumn)-1)) {
        currentColumnIdAndAliases <- append(currentColumnIdAndAliases, currentColumn[[tagIndex]][[1]][1])
      }
    }
    # Having gathered this list, we test that it consists of distinct elements:
    test_that(paste("identifier and aliases of column",currentColumn$identifier[[1]][1],"in",fileShortName,"are all distinct"),{
      # Here, instead of just checking if length(unique(x))==length(x), we compute which if any elements are duplicates, so that
      # the fail message actually tells you what the duplicates are:
      duplicates <- unique(currentColumnIdAndAliases[duplicated(currentColumnIdAndAliases)])
      expect_equal(duplicates,character(0))
    })
    # Note that we don't stop testing here if this fails, since the rest of our tests will still make sense.

    # At this point, we actually append unique(currentColumnnIdAndAliases) to the total list of identifiers and aliases, not
    # the list itself. The logic here is that if there is a duplicate inside this column, that will already have been caught
    # by the test just above, so if we add the entire list, we just pollute the fail message of the test of condition b) --
    # we want to be easily able to see failures of b) that occur because of clashes between different columns, and let clashes
    # within a column be flagged by failures of c). So:
    columnIdentifiersAndAliases <- append(columnIdentifiersAndAliases, unique(currentColumnIdAndAliases))

    # Now, we can move into the levels tag to check first a) and then d) and e):

#           a NumericRange column.
