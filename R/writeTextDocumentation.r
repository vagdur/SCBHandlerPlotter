# In order to create all the data table documentation, set working directory to the project folder, and run:
# writeAllTextDocumentation("./inst/extdata","./man")

# TODO: Add functionality to automatically remove old documentation that no longer has a corresponding XML file.



# This file contains a script that takes an XML documentation file of a table
# and produces a documentation file in the .Rd format, to make it more human
# readable. Note that this function won't be run ever by the package --
# instead it should be getting run just before build time for the package,
# to create the .Rd files to go with the package. Unfortunately there is no
# hook to do this at buildtime for an R package, so it just has to be done
# manually... It's unfortunate.

# We create this as a function which reads in the filename of the XML documentation,
# and returns the documentation as one big string. This is to make it slightly easier
# to build tests for it -- the function can then presumably be called from command line
# and piped into the right file.
writeTextDocumentation <- function(filename) {
  # The documentation can be built incrementally by just appending stuff to a string:
  doc <- ""
  # We are always documenting data, and may include some non-ASCII characters, so:
  doc <- paste(doc,'\\docType{data}\n\\encoding{utf8}\n',sep="")

  # We load the XML documentation file and turn it into a list: (Note that we assume we are given its entire path,
  # not just its filename. We also assume that the XML documentation has been tested.)

  tableTitle <- docList$title[[1]][1]
  doc <- paste(doc,'\\name{',tableName,'}\n\\alias{',tableName,'}\n\\title{',tableTitle,'}\n',sep="")

  # Now we proceed to write the documentation of the columns that are present:
  tableColumns <- docList$columns
  doc <- paste(doc,'\\format{A table with ',length(tableColumns)-1,' variables, to be queried with the SCB() function.\n\\describe{\n',sep="")
