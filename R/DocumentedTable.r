# This file defines a generic class for handling SCB tables --
# its constructor just reads in an XML file documenting the table,
# and then loads everything in.
#
# The class implements querying against the table in the syntax of
# the SCB function -- effectively the SCB function is just a wrapper
# for figuring out which table object to run the query against.
#
# Specialised table handlers, for tables that work differently in
# some regard than the default implementation, should inherit from
# this class and only change the queryer method, not any of the
# other methods.

# In order to do this, we actually need several layers of class:
# A table consists of some data, a method to query said data, and
# some information on what the columns of the data are. We implement
# this using a Column class.
# A column has a name and some aliases, and information on what levels it
# can have. In turn, we implement the level information using a Level class,
# an object of which has a name and some aliases.
# This design allows us to just have a dealias() method that takes a potential
# name of a column or level and returns either the real name of it in the underlying
# csv table, or NULL if it is not present. This seems to be the most elegant way
# of handling the possibility of many different names for the same thing.

# Throughout we will be using all the 'methods'-package functions to create our
# S4 classes, so instead of writing methods:: every time, we just import it:
#' @import methods

# We start by defining the generics we will want in several classes:
setGeneric("name", function(x) standardGeneric("name"))
setGeneric("name<-", function(x, value) standardGeneric("name<-"))
setGeneric("aliases", function(x) standardGeneric("aliases"))
setGeneric("aliases<-", function(x,value) standardGeneric("aliases<-"))
setGeneric("dealias", function(x, toDealias) standardGeneric("dealias"))

# Definition of the DocumentedTable class
# The name is chosen to specify what kind of table we're dealing with.
# A DocumentedTable contains a bunch of things:
#   1.  A name of the table
#   2.  A description of the table
#   3.  A source for the table
#   4.  A year for when the data is from
#   5.  A data.frame containing the actual data -- this should not be accessed or modified by the user.
#   6.  A list of Column objects documenting the columns, each of which contains more information
#   7.  A name of the column in the data.frame containing the numeric data
#
# There are a few methods that work on a DocumentedTable:
#   1.  Getters and setters for the first four points on the list above
#   2.  columnDealias: Implements dealiasing of columns. See the comment before that method for more detail.
#   3.  query: Implements querying against the table. See the comment before that function, or the documentation of the library for the
#       general format of querying.
#   4.  canHandleQuery: Checks whether a query makes sense against the table, and returns true or false without actually executing the query.
#       Used to route queries to the right table when we have a bunch of them. Same arguments as Query, of course.

  # and find some posts with "b" but none with "c", that might be something we want to print a message about?)


  # First, we check if we can even handle the query, in the case where checkHandleable is TRUE:

  argumentNames = names(list(...))

  # more idiomatic in R as well.

        dealiasedArgumentValue <- levelDealias(column, argumentValues[[argumentName]])

        # Okay, so now we have both the right name for the column and the right name for the levels,
        # so now we can just do the subsetting:
        desiredIndices <- (runningSubset[,dealiasedArgumentName] %in% dealiasedArgumentValue)
        runningSubset <- runningSubset[desiredIndices,]
      }
    }
  }

  # So now we have the subset that filtered down to. This is the easiest step: We just sum over
  # the valueColumn in this subset and return that number. If verbose=TRUE, we also check if the
  # query actually matched any entries, and post a message if it did not. Additionally we check if
  # the query matched some rows that have valueColumn set to NA, and if so message about that.
